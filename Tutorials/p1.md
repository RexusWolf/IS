*Git* is a version control system for **tracking changes** in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.

In this guide, we will teach you the essential knowledge of git a
how to work with it.

## **Starting in Git**

### **Some advantages of using Git**
* The ability to do and undo changes.
* History and documentations of different changes.
* Using of multiple versions of the same code at once.
* The ability to solve conflicts between version of different programmers.

## **How To Configure Git**

First of all, we will set the administrator name, email, core editor, interface, etc.

1. Change *Administrator name*
~~~
git config --global user.name "Admin Name"
~~~

2. Change *Email*
~~~
git config --global user.email name@mail.com
~~~

3. Choose your core *text editor*.
~~~
git config --global core.editor "atom"
~~~

4. Set the interface color
~~~
git config --global color.ui true
~~~

4. Show the configuration list
~~~
git config --list
~~~

## **The three steins-gate of Git**

Typically, you’ll want to start making changes and **committing** snapshots of those changes into your *repository* each time the project reaches a state you want to record.

Remember that each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: **tracked or untracked**. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. In short, tracked files are files that Git knows about.

![Git status](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/lifecycle.png)

Untracked files are everything else — any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area. When you first **clone** a repository, all of your files will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and you haven’t edited anything.

As you edit files, Git sees them as *modified*, because you’ve changed them since your last commit. As you work, you selectively stage these modified files and then commit all those **staged changes**, and the cycle repeats.



## **Basic commands on Git**

Now we're going to show you some of the most basic commands to use **Git**, first of all, we need to start a repository...

To start a repository, we have to be in the directory we wan to use and use the command:
~~~
git init
~~~

To add changes to the staging area we use: `git add`
If you want to add all the content: `git add .`

To validate the changes we use:
~~~
git commit -m "message"
~~~
With this step we've sent the changes to the git repository.

If you want to do the two steps before, faster, you can use:
~~~
git commit -am "message"
~~~

To check the commit history:
~~~
git log
~~~

For some help:
~~~
git log help
~~~

For the last 5 commits:
~~~
git log -n 5
~~~

For a date:
~~~
git log --since=2018-09-27
~~~

to listate for an author:
~~~
git log --author="Manuel Alejandro"
~~~
To see the changes in the directory:
~~~
git status
~~~

To see the diferences between the file in the directory and the file in the **Git** repository:
~~~
git diff
~~~

To see the diferences between the file in the staging and the file in the **Git** repository:
~~~
git diff --staged
~~~

To remove files:
~~~
git rm file
git commit -m "message"
~~~

To move o rename files:
~~~
git mv old new
git commit -m "message"
~~~

To undo changes with **Git**:
~~~
git checkout -- file_name
~~~

Remove file from staging:
~~~
git reset HEAD file_name
~~~

Compliment the last commit:
~~~
git commit --amend -m "message"
~~~

Recover versions from a file of a old commit:
~~~
git checkout <id_commit> -- file_name
~~~

Revert a commit:
~~~
git revert <id_commit>
~~~

Undo multiple changes in the repository:
~~~
git reset --soft <id_commit>
git reset --mixed <id_commit>
git reset --hard <id_commit>
~~~

List the files that git don't control:
~~~
git clean -n
~~~

Ignore the file in the directory:
~~~
.gitignore
~~~

List the content of the repository from git:
~~~
git ls-tree master
git ls-tree master^^^
git ls-tree master~3
~~~

Log in a line:
~~~
git log --oneline
~~~

Log with the 3 last commit in a line:
~~~
git log --oneline -3
~~~

Examinate the content of a commit:
~~~
git show <id>
~~~

Compare a commit with the actual:
~~~
git diff <id> file_name
~~~

Compare two commits:
~~~
git diff id ... id file_name
~~~

Clone a repository:
~~~
git clone "repository url"
~~~

## **Git & Github**

*GitHub Inc.* is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git.
That's it, Git is the sofware that allows you to **track and host** versions of files on Github. In other words, you use commands of Git to track versions of your files. And Github is just a remote platform where these files are hosted.

If you want to know more about Github, you can visit our [Github tutorial](https://github.com/RexusWolf/IS/blob/master/Tutorials/tutorial_github.md) and give us some feedback.

*GitHub* is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration using **Git**. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere so it's commonly ussed in **Open Source projects** and it has its own community.

This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches and commits.

## **Starting in Github**

To complete this tutorial, you need a GitHub.com account and Internet access. You don’t need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software GitHub is built on). To install Git you can follow our [Git Tutorial](https://github.com/RexusWolf/IS/blob/master/tutorial_git.md).

When you create your first acount, you should visit the **Settings** section on top of the page.

# **Step 1. Create a repository**

A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain **folders and files**, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. You can also ignore some files to be in your repository if you want to keep them private. Take a look at our [Git Tutorial](https://github.com/RexusWolf/IS/p1/tutorial_git.md) and look for the *.gitignore* command.

We recommend including a **README.md**, or a file with information about your project, as we [did here](https://github.com/RexusWolf/IS/blob/master/README.md). GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository but you can also create it using your source code editor. You can also add a a **license file** in your repository to make it easier for other people to contribute.

Your repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others and cowork with them.

## **To create a new repository**
1. In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click
2. and then select **New repository**.
3. Name your repository.
4. **(OPTIONAL)** Write a short description.
5. Select **Initialize this repository with a README**.
6. Click **Create repository**.

![repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/create-new-repo.png)

# **Step 2. Create a branch**

In git, branches represent different lines of work. Each branch works independently from the rest, and has its own commit history.
**Branching** is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

By default your repository has one branch named `master` which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.

Branches are very useful, as they can be used to make quick changes to the code **without affecting** or having to commit WIP or long-term changes; or to work on the same files parallely and solving the possible conflicts.

### 2. Basic branching
Each repository has at least one branch, called `master` by default. To create a new branch we use the command `git branch <name>`. This creates a new branch, but we are still working in `master`. To switch the working branch we use `git checkout <name>`. Both commands can be combined in `git checkout -b <name>` which creates a branch and switches to it. Simply typing 'git branch' lists all the branches in the repository.

![branch](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/readme-edits.gif)


When we are finished making the changes and/or want to fuse two branches together we use `git merge <name>`. This `merge`applies the changes of the branch `<name>` to the current working branch, and marks the conflicts, which are normally solved manually, by choosing to keep the changes in one of the branches or both of them.

This diagram shows:
* The `master` branch.
* A new branch called `feature` (because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch).
* The journey that `feature` takes before it’s merged into `master`.

![diagram](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/branching.png)

Now you have two branches, `master` and `readme-edits`. They look exactly the same, but not for long! Next we’ll add our changes to the new branch.

### 3. Stashing
Stashing is used when you want to switch branches and save your previous work without doing a commit. This is done with the `git stash` command. Using it saves all the modifications to the tracked files and staged changes in a stack, so they can be reapplied at any time, and cleans them from the repository. To get those changes back, we use `git stash <pop/apply> [name]` if name is not specified, git will try to apply the most recent stash.

### 4. Other commands used with branches
We can easily compare branches with 'git diff <branch1> <branch2>', see which branches are the same as the current branch with 'git branch --merged'. To delete a branch we use 'git branch -D <name>', and to rename it, 'git branch -m <old name> <new name>'

Visit our [Git tutorial](https://github.com/RexusWolf/IS/blob/master/Tutorials/tutorial_git.md) if you want to know more about common branches commands.


# **Step 3. Make and commit changes**

On GitHub, saved changes are called **commits**. Each commit has an associated *commit message*, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

We think commits are one of the most important things in a Github repository timeline because you can always look at its commits and see where exactly something was modified. That allows us to prevent our project to fail.

## **Make and commit changes**
Click the **README.md** file.
Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
You can write whatever you want in the editor.
Write a commit message that describes your changes.
Click **Commit changes** button.

![commit](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/commit.png)

These changes will be made to just the **README.md** file on your `branch`, so now this branch contains content that’s different from master.
