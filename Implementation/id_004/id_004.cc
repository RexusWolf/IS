// ID_004: Modify Team Leader
/*
**Main flow:**
 1. The study case starts when the system needs to modify a student.
 2. The system asks for the team's number.
 3. The system modifies the role of the team's leader.
 4. The system asks the user who will be the team's leader of the team.
 4. The system modifies the new team's leader role.
 5. The system saves the data.

 **Alternative flow:**

  3. a. If the team doesn't have a leader the system does nothing.
  4. a. If the student doesn't exists, the system shows an error message and ask for the student DNI/Surname again.
