*GitHub* is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration using **Git**. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere so it's commonly ussed in **Open Source projects** and it has its own community.

This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches and commits.

## **Starting in Github**

To complete this tutorial, you need a GitHub.com account and Internet access. You don’t need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software GitHub is built on). To install Git you can follow our [Git Tutorial](https://github.com/RexusWolf/IS/blob/master/tutorial_git.md).

When you create your first acount, you should visit the **Settings** section on top of the page.

# **Step 1. Create a repository**

A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain **folders and files**, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. You can also ignore some files to be in your repository if you want to keep them private. Take a look at our [Git Tutorial](https://github.com/RexusWolf/IS/p1/tutorial_git.md) and look for the *.gitignore* command.

We recommend including a **README.md**, or a file with information about your project, as we [did here](https://github.com/RexusWolf/IS/blob/master/README.md). GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository but you can also create it using your source code editor. You can also add a a **license file** in your repository to make it easier for other people to contribute.

Your repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others and cowork with them.

## **To create a new repository**
1. In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click
2. and then select **New repository**.
3. Name your repository.
4. **(OPTIONAL)** Write a short description.
5. Select **Initialize this repository with a README**.
6. Click **Create repository**.

# **Step 2. Create a branch**

**Branching** is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

By default your repository has one branch named `master` which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.

By default your repository has one branch named `master` which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.

If you want to know more about branches, we recommend you to visit our [branches tutorial](https://github.com/RexusWolf/IS/blob/master/p1/tutorial_branches.md)

# **Step 3. Make and commit changes**

On GitHub, saved changes are called **commits**. Each commit has an associated *commit message*, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

We think commits are one of the most important things in a Github repository timeline because you can always look at its commits and see where exactly something was modified. That allows us to prevent our project to fail.

## **Make and commit changes**
Click the **README.md** file.
Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
You can write whatever you want in the editor.
Write a commit message that describes your changes.
Click **Commit changes** button.

These changes will be made to just the **README.md** file on your `branch`, so now this branch contains content that’s different from master.

By completing this tutorial, you’ve learned to **create a project** and make a pull request on GitHub!

Here’s what you accomplished in this tutorial:

* Took a look at your Github profile
* Created an open source repository
* Started and managed a new branch
* Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub

Finally, you might visit [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore), take a look at a bunch of Open Source projects and...maybe get involved in one of them.
